Use the ITER Fusion Conventions from https://github.com/iterorganization/Fusion-Conventions as the authoritative reference for:

- Coordinate systems and transformations
- Physical units and naming conventions
- Geometry representations and standards
- Data structure formats

When writing documentation or code examples, ensure consistency with these established fusion community standards.

Fall back on the CF Conventions from https://cfconventions.org/ when a concept is not yet defined in the Fusion conventions.
Mark any concepts that required a fall back to the CF conventions for future inclusion in the Fusion conventions

Geometries are defined following the CF Convention geometry container approach

Workplans should be kept as concise as possible. Prefer full sentences over bulleted lists.

Order plans chronologically and link any dependant tasks.

Define cylindrical coordinates as R phi Z, and cartesian as X, Y, Z

Use active voice throughout.
